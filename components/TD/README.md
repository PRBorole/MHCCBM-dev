But we only use data from Bashirova because  Ilca doesn't provide MFI ratios for all HLA.

What are the good threshold for MFI ratio?
1. Median: Median is 3.61 but A*02:01 which has Tapasin dependency has MFI ratio of 2 (see Barber et al)
2. Threshold=2.0 There are only 18 negative classes below MFI ratio 2
3. Treat as regression?
